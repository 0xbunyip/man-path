#### 1-1s
Have regular 1-1s (e.g., weekly).
Adjusting case by case (depends on relationship, seniority, etc).

4 types:
* Todo: agree upfront the future tasks and dive deep into them 
(quite formal, not much room for building personal understanding)
* Catch up: let your report talks about whatever happen right now (e.g., company policy, project news, etc)
* Feedback/coaching: once per quarter, talk about their future, promotion, needs, improvements
* Progress update: not really needed since stand-up meetings are enough

Leave room to discuss about personal topics: hobbies, goals, like/dislike, family, etc.
Get to know them personally to develop trust. Make sure to not only care about the team but also the individual.

Tip: take note during/after each 1-1s to monitor long term progress and to consult when doing performance reviews.

#### Micromanage
Must respect people's **autonomy**: ability to control part of their work.

To avoid micromanagement:
* Establish goals/metrics and monitor it to see if you need to step in
* Depends on the stage of the project: monitor more in the final stages

#### Performance reviews
Tips:
* Account for the whole year, avoid recency bias: review 1-1 notes to remind yourself
* Spend time on postive/praises as well: know when to promote
* Focus on few things for improvements: more focused, easier to see progress
* Avoid negative surprises: regular 1-1s should give plenty of head-ups before the big review
