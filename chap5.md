# Managing a team

Unlike being a tech lead, being a manager requires a whole new set of skills.
It's a mix between people management (responsible for your team members) 
and engineering management (responsible for the tech aspect of the product).

### Staying technical

You should still take on small technical work (e.g., code small features, debugging, code reviews) for 2 reasons:
1. Understanding the difficulty that engineers face everyday
2. Better estimation when discussing workload/timeline with other departments

### Dysfunctional teams

4 typical types of dysfunctional teams:
1. Late/not shipping features: either because the process is too cumbersome or unmotivated
2. People drama (toxic individual/brilliant jerk): 1-1s with them to provide corrective feedbacks or cut tie if nothing else could be done
3. Overwork: prioritize your tasks, explain clearly the reason to team members and try not to let this happen again 
4. Collab issue with other teams

### Shielding

It can be a good idea to shield your members from outside noises (politics, drama, etc).
But when serious issues happen (e.g., big lay-off), communicate clearly and with little emotion will make people get over things faster.

Also, it's better to nurture an environment where problems can surface quickly and be solved instead of pretending nothing is wrong.

Tip: review outcome of your decisions to always learn from them!

### The Dos and Don'ts of managing conflict

* Voting is good when:
  - Everyone has a high level of understanding of the objective
  - Has enough incentive to make good decisions
  - Unbias toward all options

Therefore, sometimes, you must make a decision instead of letting the whole team decide for you.

* Don't be afraid of making a decision, try to make sense of them to get through that fear 
(Am I making the best decisions to the entire team?)

* Be kind, don't be nice. Nice is saying "I'm fine" when you are in a bad mood.
Kind is telling someone their mistakes instead of keeping silence and letting them fail afterward.
