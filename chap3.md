#### Managing projects
Planning isn't about thinking about all possible outcomes, catching all details and executing it perfectly.
It's about creating a habit of thinking about the whole project before diving into executing it.
It's the thought and time spent in the planning process that make planning a beneficial activity.
#### Managing a project
1. Break the project into small pieces; break the pieces into smaller ones until arriving at a unit of work (a task)
2. Sort the task according to their dependencies
3. Find out which tasks can be worked in parallel
4. Go through the risks: what can go wrong, what are the unknowns, what can slow the project down/make it fail
5. Push through the pain: all the unknowns, the details might be tedious, boring and painful; but it has to be done
6. Adjust the plan on the fly: things will deviate but the plan is a guideline to get things back on track
e.g., for requirement changes, the plan can show how much that change costs and the risk involves
#### Individual contributor vs manager
Each role has benefits and drawbacks, expectations of the role might be different from real life.
Remember that you can switch tracks: you can try out the management path and come back to IC if it doesn't fit you well.
#### Process czar
Process czar: someone follows the rules/tools strictly; 
cannot cope with uncertainty; 
reprimand members for not following the rules.
#### How to be a great tech lead
1. Understand the infrastructure: impossible to lead without deep understanding, should be 1st priority
2. Be a team player: switch between boring (as a senior, you're more likely to find a better way to do the task) 
and exciting work (to hone your skills as a senior dev)
3. Decision making: the job of a tech lead is to help the team make a decision, not making it for them. 
When necessary, make a decision instead of letting 2 members arguing to no ends.
There are 3 ways of making a decision: by yourself, by delegating to someone with a better understanding (senior devs) 
and by the team.
All 3 ways need transparency between all members about who/why/how a decision is made
4. Communicate: most important point - communicate effectively, practice listening 
(really paying attention, not just thinking about your response).
Practice writing (clean, precise documents) and speaking (presentation, 1v1).
Tip: repeating things back to make sure you understand; rephrase a concept in your own words to deepen the understanding; 
practice note-taking
